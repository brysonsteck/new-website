The source files for my new website. What else can I say.

## Build

To build the development server, you need to install the Python dependencies and create the database. This can be accomplished by doing the following:

1. Run the `install.py` script to install the dependencies
1. Replace the value `SECRET_KEY` by running the command mentioned in the file.
1. Run `python manage.py migrate` afterwards to set up the database with the new key.
